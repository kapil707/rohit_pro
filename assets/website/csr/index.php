		<h4>Essential Elements incorporated in a Perfect Real Estate Marketing Plan</h4>
		<p>So now we have all of this great information about marketing your real estate investment business.  Let's break it down into a basic checklist to get you started on your way to establishing a great marketing plan. </p>
		<p>Elevator Speech   An elevator speech is a "must have" tool for marketing your business and finding private lenders.  A simple 60-second speech about what you do and what you have accomplished will leave you prepared to network with anyone you meet, anywhere, and any time of the day. Make it concise, to the point, and then practice it.  </p>
		<p>Direct Response Marketing   Start creating a direct response marketing campaign by writing letters, sending postcards, and offering free information about your business. You can do this effectively by creating and building a good swipe file and then honing some basic copywriting skills for writing attention-grabbing headlines and hitting the right buttons in the advertising message. Combine this with a well developed mailing list and you are on your way to a successful direct response marketing campaign.   </p>
		<p>Speeches and Presentations develop a great speech or educational presentation on your real estate investment business. During the speech or presentation, offer free advice and show your expertise as a real estate investor, as well as the benefits the client will receive by investing in your real estate deal.  </p>

		<p>Internet Word of mouth advertising is a powerful way to get the word out about your real estate investment business and the Internet is no different. Take it upon yourself to get a social media page going on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, and some of the other social media sites.   Establish a blog that offers information and advice for other real estate investors and contribute to their blog in return. Create articles in your blog that offer advice on real estate investing and use them on article marketing sites.   Develop an online mailing list and start an online newsletter that offers information on real estate investment that is targeted toward your specific audience and real estate niche.   If you feel really ambitious, create a website that offers all of your products and services in one location as well as another source where people can contact you. You can use your website address in all of your email signatures, on social media sites, blogs, and article marketing sites.</p>
